# README

This project is a wiki replica site and was made with Bloc.io

It allows users to sign up using the [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/deviDevise) gem

Authorization was implemented using the [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) gem

A sample upgrade payment option was made available with [Stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby)




This site highlights my understanding of CRUD, relationships through a join table, and the implementation of gems into a project.
